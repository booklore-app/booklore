## üê≥ Deploy with Docker

You can quickly set up and run BookLore using Docker.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Docker & Docker Compose

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create docker-compose.yml

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with content:

```yaml
services:
  booklore:
    image: ghcr.io/adityachandelgit/booklore-app:latest
    container_name: booklore
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - DATABASE_URL=jdbc:mariadb://mariadb:3306/booklore   # Only modify this if you're familiar with JDBC and your database setup
      - DATABASE_USERNAME=booklore                          # Must match MYSQL_USER defined in the mariadb container
      - DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password              # Use a strong password; must match MYSQL_PASSWORD defined in the mariadb container 
      - SWAGGER_ENABLED=false                               # Enable or disable Swagger UI (API docs). Set to 'true' to allow access; 'false' to block access (recommended for production).
    depends_on:
      mariadb:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "6060:6060"
    volumes:
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/data:/app/data       # Internal app data (settings, metadata, cache)
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/books1:/books1       # Book library folder ‚Äî point to one of your collections
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/books2:/books2       # Another book library ‚Äî you can mount multiple library folders this way
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/bookdrop:/bookdrop   # Bookdrop folder ‚Äî drop new files here for automatic import into libraries
    restart: unless-stopped

  mariadb:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:11.4.5
    container_name: mariadb
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=super_secure_password  # Use a strong password for the database's root user, should be different from MYSQL_PASSWORD
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=booklore
      - MYSQL_USER=booklore                        # Must match DATABASE_USERNAME defined in the booklore container
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_secure_password        # Use a strong password; must match DATABASE_PASSWORD defined in the booklore container
    volumes:
      - /your/local/path/to/mariadb/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mariadb-admin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
```
Note: You can find the latest BookLore image tag `BOOKLORE_IMAGE_TAG` (e.g. v.0.x.x) from the Releases section:

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Containers

Run the following command to start the services:

```ini
docker compose up -d
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Access BookLore

Once the containers are up, access BookLore in your browser at:

```ini
http://localhost:6060
```
## üì• Bookdrop Folder: Auto-Import Files (New)

BookLore now supports a **Bookdrop folder**, a special directory where you can drop your book files (`.pdf`, `.epub`, `.cbz`, etc.), and BookLore will automatically detect, process, and prepare them for import. This makes it easy to bulk add new books without manually uploading each one.

### üîç How It Works

1. **File Watcher:** A background process continuously monitors the Bookdrop folder.
2. **File Detection:** When new files are added, BookLore automatically reads them and extracts basic metadata (title, author, etc.) from filenames or embedded data.
3. **Optional Metadata Fetching:** If enabled, BookLore can query metadata sources like Google Books or Open Library to enrich the book information.
4. **Review & Finalize:** You can then review the detected books in the Bookdrop UI, edit metadata if needed, and assign each book to a library and folder structure before finalizing the import.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (Docker Setup)

To enable the Bookdrop feature in Docker:

```yaml
services:
  booklore:
    ...
    volumes:
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/data:/app/data
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/books:/books
      - /your/local/path/to/booklore/bookdrop:/bookdrop # üëà Bookdrop directory
```      
      
## üîë OIDC/OAuth2 Authentication (Authentik, Pocket ID, etc.)


BookLore supports optional OIDC/OAuth2 authentication for secure access. This feature allows you to integrate external authentication providers for a seamless login experience.

While the integration has been tested with **Authentik** and **Pocket ID**, it should work with other OIDC providers like **Authelia** as well. The setup allows you to use either JWT-based local authentication or external providers, giving users the flexibility to choose their preferred method.
